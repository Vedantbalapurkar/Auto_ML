# Auto_ML

The objective of this project is to develop an Auto-ML machine learning model that can automate the data visualization,
data preprocessing, and modelling steps involved in a machine learning project. This will allow data scientists and analysts
to build machine learning models more quickly and easily, without having to manually perform these time-consuming
tasks.
